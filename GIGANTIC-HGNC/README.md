GIGANTIC HGNC README file.

This directory contains scripts used to generate Blastp COG analysis of Species19 genomes for the Aplysia genome paper.

Scripts and work was done by Eric Edsinger summer 2022 as a research scientist at the Salk Institute in the Chalasani Lab / a visiting researcher at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories marine field station. Scripts were initially developed and implemented as in support of the University of Washington Friday Laboratories Biodiverity Genomics research apprenticeship.
