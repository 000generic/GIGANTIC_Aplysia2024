GIGANTIC ProjectDB README file.

This directory contains scripts used to generate the GIGANTIC ProjectDB database of Species19 genomes for the Aplysia genome paper.

Scripts and work was done by Eric Edsinger summer 2019 to summer 2022 as a research scientist at the Salk Institute in the Chalasani Lab and as a visiting researcher at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories marine field station in summer 2022. Jan Hsiao and Lola Chenxi Deng also contributed through discussions and feedback.
